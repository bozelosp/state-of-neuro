  "system_prompt": "You are an expert keyword and topic extractor, specializing in scientific literature. Your primary role is to identify and extract the most relevant and significant keywords and topics from given texts, particularly research abstracts and articles.\nKey responsibilities:\n\nTags:\n1. Accurately identify the most important concepts, techniques, and terms from the provided text.\n2. Extract 10 specific keywords directly from the text.\n3. Preserve the original capitalization of terms as they appear in scientific literature.\nCapitalization guidelines:\n- Maintain proper nouns, disease names, and specific scientific terms as they are typically capitalized in academic writing. For example: \"Alzheimer's disease\", \"Parkinson's disease\", \"Huntington's disease\".\n- Keep gene names, protein names, and similar scientific identifiers in their standard format. For example: \"APOE4\", \"Plexin-B1\", \"BDNF\".\n- Use lowercase for general scientific terms unless they are typically capitalized in the field. For example: \"neurons\", \"astrocytes\", \"microglia\", but \"DNA\", \"RNA\".\n\nTopics:\n1. Identify 4-5 as broad as possible, but non-vague, topics describing the text, even if they're not explicitly mentioned. Good and meaningful topic examples: \"neurological disorders\", \"cancer treatment\", \"gene therapy\". They should essentially be a field or a niche within a field. Order them from broadest to more niche.\n2. Topics should be concise, preferably 1-2 words, and only 2 words (extremely rarely the case) if it's a widely recognized topic in scientific literature.\n2. Always use lowercase for topics, as opposed to text.\n\nPresent your extracted keywords as a string with the keywords separated by \"; \" and joined by \" =//= \" for the topics part. NO OTHER TEXT OR COMMENTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RESPONSE.\n\nLike this: \"Alzheimer's disease; neuroinflammation; astrocytes; microglia; amyloid plaques; neuritic dystrophy; Plexin-B1; glial nets; cell distancing =//= neuroscience; neurodegenerative diseases; memory loss; glia\"\n\nAlways strive for accuracy and relevance in your selections, as these keywords may be used for indexing, searching, or summarizing scientific content. Same for topics, they will be used for CMS and SEO purposes.\n\nPS 1: Never forget to order the topics from broadest to more niche. It is super important. I hope you understand. I will tip $20 if you respect this rule!\nPS 2: The topics need to be meaningful. \"genetics\" is meaningful, \"cellular diversity\" isn't -- it's not even a niche!",

      "content": "Nf1 mutation disrupts activity-dependent oligodendroglial plasticity and motor learning in mice\nNeurogenetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can cause cognitive and motor impairments, traditionally attributed to intrinsic neuronal defects such as disruption of synaptic function. Activity-regulated oligodendroglial plasticity also contributes to cognitive and motor functions by tuning neural circuit dynamics. However, the relevance of oligodendroglial plasticity to neurological dysfunction in NF1 is unclear. Here we explore the contribution of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to pathological features of the NF1 syndrome in mice. Both male and female littermates (4\u201324 weeks of age) were used equally in this study. We demonstrate that mice with global or OPC-specific Nf1 heterozygosity exhibit defects in activity-dependent oligodendrogenesis and harbor focal OPC hyperdensities with disrupted homeostatic OPC territorial boundaries. These OPC hyperdensities develop in a cell-intrinsic Nf1 mutation-specific manner due to differential PI3K/AKT activation. OPC-specific Nf1 loss impairs oligodendroglial differentiation and abrogates the normal oligodendroglial response to neuronal activity, leading to impaired motor learning performance. Collectively, these findings show that Nf1 mutation delays oligodendroglial development and disrupts activity-dependent OPC function essential for normal motor learning in mice."

      "content": "A single-vector intersectional AAV strategy for interrogating cellular diversity and brain function. As discovery of cellular diversity in the brain accelerates, so does the need for tools that target cells based on multiple features. Here we developed Conditional Viral Expression by Ribozyme Guided Degradation (ConVERGD), an adeno-associated virus-based, single-construct, intersectional targeting strategy that combines a self-cleaving ribozyme with traditional FLEx switches to deliver molecular cargo to specific neuronal subtypes. ConVERGD offers benefits over existing intersectional expression platforms, such as expanded intersectional targeting with up to five recombinase-based features, accommodation of larger and more complex payloads and a vector that is easy to modify for rapid toolkit expansion. In the present report we employed ConVERGD to characterize an unexplored subpopulation of norepinephrine (NE)-producing neurons within the rodent locus coeruleus that co-express the endogenous opioid gene prodynorphin (Pdyn). These studies showcase ConVERGD as a versatile tool for targeting diverse cell types and reveal Pdyn-expressing NE+ locus coeruleus neurons as a small neuronal subpopulation capable of driving anxiogenic behavioral responses in rodents."
